Voxel

This is the Github page of a voxel based game.
Developed by Thomas & co.

if you make any changes, make them either in new branch. Never in the "master", let's keep that for stuff that is going to stay around for a while. It would be great if we could keep seperate features in seperate branches until they are ready to be put into the master. i.e. if you want to work on Physics, make a new branch to use, then merge it only after it's mostly done.
